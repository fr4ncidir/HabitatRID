NAME:
	ridReader - reads from Unibo's Habitat rfid reader
SYNOPSIS:
	ridReader [-nREPEAT] [-uUSB_PORT] [-fJSON_PARAMETER FILE]
OPTIONS DESCRIPTION:

-nREPEAT DESCRIPTION
	-nXXX
		written in the form -n45, for example, identifies the number of iterations to be done.
		If absent, we consider it equivalent to -n0, which means "infinite iterations".
-uUSB_PORT
	Must be the address in /dev/ folder to the USB device. For instance /dev/ttyUSB0
-fPARAMETRIZATION_FILE
	-f./myparams.json
		Specifies the location of the parametrization file. This parameter is compulsory.
		The file is made as follows:
		
{
	"radius_threshold":1000,			Int number, threshold for N-Pro0 high/low params choice
	"N1_low":2,							[N1|N2|N3]_[low|high] path loss exponent for the three calibration zones
	"N2_low":2,
	"N3_low":2,
	"Pr01_low":-45.0,					Pr0[1|2|3]_[low|high] RSSI @ reference distance for the three calibration zones
	"Pr02_low":-45.0,
	"Pr03_low":-45.0,
	"N1_high":3, 
	"N2_high":3,
    "N3_high":3,
	"Pr01_high":-74.0,
	"Pr02_high":-72.0,
    "Pr03_high":-74.0,
	"delta_Degrees":90,					Angular span of the reader
	"delta_Theta0":0,					Angular offset of the reader (positive values clockwise, negative counterclockwise)
    "Angle_Iterations":40,				Number of angular scan iterations (don't you dare!)
	"Bottom_Left_Corner_Distance":2.45,	Calibration related to RID position in the room
    "sepa_ip":"",						http://www.sepa.it:8000/query, for instance
	"ID_rid":1,							Unique id of the reader in use
	"loc_time":1000						ms pause after each scan
}
	
Exit status:
	0 if exit success
	1 otherwise - check stderr
